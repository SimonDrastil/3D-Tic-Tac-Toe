Overview

This project is a web-based version of Tic-Tac-Toe with a 3D layered rule. The game starts with one 3Ã—3 board. If it ends in a tie, a new floor is added on top. Up to three floors can be created, and players can win with lines across rows, columns, diagonals, or even through all three floors.

Floors are added automatically when ties happen.

The game checks all possible 2D and 3D winning lines.

Testing & Results
